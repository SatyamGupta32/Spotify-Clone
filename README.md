# Spotify-Clone

## Introduction
In this project, we'll create a basic clone of the Spotify Music App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this won't replicate all the functionality of Spotify, it will focus on mimicking the layout and visual design of the homepage and ensuring it is responsive on all devices.

## Sections
The project is divided into three main sections:-

## Setups

Create a new folder for your project.
- Inside the folder, create index.html, styles.css, responsive.css and script.js files.
HTML Section

- Divide the layout into two main sections: left and right.

# 1. Left Section

### Home
  - This section contains the logo and a list of home and search icons.
  - In the responsive side of the mobile web-view, it also contains a cross to close the sidebar.
  
### Playlist
  - This section contains a list of songs. When we click on a card, the song is selected to play from the list.
  
### 2. Right Section
### Header
  - The header section includes arrow buttons and SignUp/Login buttons which get a hover effect.
  - In the responsive view, a hamburger menu is used to open the sidebar.
  
### Main
  - This section contains a card list. Clicking on a card populates the song in the library section, and the first song auto-plays whenever any card is clicked.
  - It includes show all and close functionalities to show/hide the number of cards.
  - A play bar displays the song's current playtime and full duration. It also includes play/pause buttons, prev/next 
    buttons, and a volume button for increasing/decreasing the sound and muting/unmuting the song.

### CSS Section
- Create a reliable and user-interactive UI design with a responsive layout, cool hover effects, and many more features.

### JavaScript Section
  - Add seamless functionality by creating a backend-like copy for fetching albums and songs from the server from our own 
    directory.
  - Add a hamburger menu feature for small devices.
  - Populate songs when clicking on a card, include autoplay functionality, play/pause buttons,display current song name,        time, and full duration.
  - Include mute/unmute features on the volume button, and next/prev song functionality when clicking a button.

### Conclusion
  - This clone project will provide knowledge towards frontend development skills for a song app, enabling you to create any     song player with these skillsets.
